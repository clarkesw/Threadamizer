4.Exercise four

   We are going to read a file invalidpasswords.txt in this exercise. The file contains a few words that must 
not be used as a password. Assume that a user enters a password as a string. As part of password validation, we need to 
check that the password is not among these words in the file.

   Output - The output must be true or false.

   The solution is in ExerciseFourSolution.java

   

5.Exercise five

   We are going to read a file sample.txt in this exercise. The file contains few lines. 
The file is considered a valid file if every line starts with a "#" and ends with a "#". 
If one of the lines does not contain this delimiter, then the entire file is considered an invalid file.

   Output - The output must be true or false.

   The solution is in ExerciseFiveSolution.java

   

6.Exercise Six

    Understanding the behavior of takeWhile operation. Refer to the file TakeWhileListSet.java

    Take a look at the code, the source of the stream in the first half of the code is a List and in the 2nd part, it is a Set. 
In both cases, we are calling the takeWhile operation. Run this file a few times, take a look at the output. 
The code also contains a call to the peek function. This will help you to understand the behavior of takeWhile 
along with the concept of ordering on the stream.
